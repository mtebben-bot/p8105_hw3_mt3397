Homework 3
================

## Problem 1

``` r
data("instacart")
```

This dataset has 1384617 rows and 15 columns.

There are variables based on the user/order – user ID, order ID, order
number, order day, order hour. There are also variables based on the
item – name, aisle, department, product ID.

#### How many aisles, and which aisles are the most items ordered from?

``` r
aisles_count = 
  instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

There are 134 aisles and most items are ordered from fresh vegetables
and fresh fruits.

#### Time to make a plot

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  filter(n > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(
    aisle = factor(aisle),
    aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n))+
  geom_point()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

#### Three most popular items in the aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(product_name) %>% 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(rank < 4) %>% 
  arrange(aisle, rank) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 |    n | rank |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | ---: | ---: |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |

#### Table for mean hour of the day where Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>% 
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow,
    values_from = mean_hour
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'product_name' (override with `.groups` argument)

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 8
    ## # Groups:   product_name [2]
    ##   product_name       `0`   `1`   `2`   `3`   `4`   `5`   `6`
    ##   <chr>            <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 Coffee Ice Cream  13.8  14.3  15.4  15.3  15.2  12.3  13.8
    ## 2 Pink Lady Apples  13.4  11.4  11.7  14.2  11.6  12.8  11.9

## Problem 2

``` r
read.csv("data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
  pivot_longer( activity.1:activity.1440,
    names_to = "minute",
    names_prefix = "activity.",
    values_to = "activity_count"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    day = factor(day),
    minute = as.numeric(minute),
    weekday_weekend = recode(day, "Monday" = "weekday", "Tuesday" = "weekday", "Wednesday" = "weekday", "Thursday" = "weekday", "Friday" = "weekday", "Saturday" = "weekend", "Sunday" = "weekend"))
```

    ## # A tibble: 50,400 x 6
    ##     week day_id day    minute activity_count weekday_weekend
    ##    <int>  <int> <fct>   <dbl>          <dbl> <fct>
